Source: https://platedcravings.com/german-christmas-baking-vanillekipferl/


Ingredients:

For the cookie dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour spoon and level
1 pinch of salt
1 cup unsalted butter cold, cut into small cubes
3⁄4 cup powdered sugar
3⁄4 cup finely ground almonds or hazelnuts or walnuts 
1⁄2 vanilla pod seeds scraped out or 2 tsp vanilla extract

For the sugar mixture:
3⁄4 cup powdered sugar
1 Tbsp vanilla sugar see note above

Instructions:

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine flour, salt, cubed butter, powdered sugar, ground nuts, and vanilla seeds. Mix at medium speed until a crumbly dough forms, about 1-2 minutes. If the dough is too crumbly add 1-2 Tbsp water.

2. Use your hands to press the dough together and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill the dough for one hour in the fridge.

3. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper.

4. Roll the chilled dough into a log approximately 1/2 inch thick. Cut the log into 1 1/2-inch pieces, form the pieces into small cylinders and taper the ends into dull points. Bend each one into a crescent shape. Place the Vanillekipferl on the baking sheet about 1 inch apart.

5. Bake the Vanillekipferl one cookie sheet at a time for 12 to 15 min (depending on the size of the cookies) until the edges are golden. They should not brown.

6. Combine powdered sugar with the vanilla sugar and sift the mixture over the hot Vanillekipferl. Let them cool completely then give them a second dusting.

7. These cookies keep fresh for about 3 weeks in an airtight container stored in a cool place.
